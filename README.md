# Uncover UI

This extension removes UI elements in Gmail and Google Docs that cover other,
more important UI elements. (See screenshot.) 

Uncover UI currently only works for some elements in some Google applications. I
can easily extended it if you send me a feature request. üôÇ

Uncover UI is designed to be as simple as possible, and has no functionality
other than removing annoying overlay elements. This is easy to see in the very
short and simple implementation.

There is nothing to configure. To use Uncover UI, simply press the Lightning
(‚ö°Ô∏è) icon in the Chrome toolbar. If you want to get the overlay elements back,
simply reload the page.
